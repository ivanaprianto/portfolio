                This project originated out of a need to measure the output of a gasifier that a separate team developed to enter a competition.
                The device needed "Artificial Intelligence" of which I had no interest whatsoever, however, I was presented with the opportunity work on the hardware of the "Electronic Nose" prototype, so of course I immediately accepted it and started.
                The original prototype was made using the design of an incubator but made smaller and out of polycarbonate before moving to a full-size incubator made out of glass.
                It was made up of 3 sets of 8 types of gas sensors for measuring gas contents in the chamber, a humidity sensor to assist, and 7 outside thermocouples meant to be connected to the gasifier itself to read temperature inside.

                The current model is made out of a PVC pipe and features a similar sensor arrangement, but with significantly tidier wiring as it was done without needing to worry about future upgrades.
                The design was chosen because it was meant to connect straight to the gasifier and the pipe design meant it could easily be connected and also be capable for a future upgrade involving airspeed sensors to add flow rate into the data stream

                Early testing showed that the H2Nose is not particularly accurate but was responsive enough to show differences when exposed to a burnt tissue, this caused damage to the sensor as it overheated it and broke around half of the sensors. 
                Later we switched methods into simply letting the liquids we chose evaporate along with a new set of sensors to ensure that we are getting accurate data, and with the changes to the methodology we saw a more accurate reading and more responsive sensors in the long term, as they weren't killed by the heat.
